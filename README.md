UPI Fraud Detection System
📌 Overview

The UPI Fraud Detection System is a machine learning-based application designed to identify and flag potentially fraudulent UPI transactions. The system analyzes transaction patterns and classifies transactions as legitimate or suspicious to support fraud prevention and risk assessment.

🚀 Features

Transaction data preprocessing and cleaning

Feature engineering for fraud detection

Machine learning model for classification

Fraud probability prediction

Basic frontend interface for user interaction

🧠 How It Works

Collects transaction-related features (amount, frequency, location, time patterns, etc.).

Performs preprocessing and pattern analysis.

Trains a supervised machine learning model.

Classifies transactions as Fraudulent or Legitimate.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Flask (for frontend/backend integration)

📊 Machine Learning Approach

Data preprocessing and feature scaling

Model training using classification algorithms

Performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

🎯 Objective

To assist in early fraud detection by analyzing transaction behavior patterns and reducing financial risk.
